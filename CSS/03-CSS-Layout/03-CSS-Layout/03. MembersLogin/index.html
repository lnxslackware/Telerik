            <p>
                Total Management is a free, tableless, W3C-compliant web design layout by Template World. This template has 
                been tested and proven compatiable with all major browser environments and operating systems. You are free to 
                modify the design to suite your tests in every way you like.<br />
                We only ask to not remove <span class="white">"Design by Template World"</span> and the link http://www.templateworld.com from the footer 
                of the template.<br />
